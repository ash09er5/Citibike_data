# Citibike_data
# Overview
In this module we had to visualize the city bike data from a csv file. This was a 
means of getting used to this unfimailr software. This challenge was a little tricky at first but then i soon
was able to navigate through tableau quickly and i started to figure out how to make these visualizations
